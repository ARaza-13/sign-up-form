This project is a basic template sign-up form for an imaginary service 

Making this project required the use of HTML form concepts and form validation along with CSS positioning and other intermediate concepts

The HTML form comes with built in live inline validation to inform the user whether a field meets the valid requirements.
All validation checks were done using Javascript Constraint Validation API.
